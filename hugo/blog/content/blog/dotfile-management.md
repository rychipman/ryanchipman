Dotfiles represent the lion's share of the configuration that I care about on any given machine.

Requirements:

- Dotfiles can be stored in a git repository

Like-to-Haves:

- Dotfiles can be used in environments where software can't be installed
- Hooks to manage groupings of dotfiles
- Allowing multiple versions of same dotfile set to exist

Stow:

- Reflect directory tree


Consider:

- Stow
- git in home dir
- rcm
- vcsh/myrepos
