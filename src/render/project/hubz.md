During the Spring of my freshman year (February 2013 - July 2013), I made my first foray into MIT's UROP (Undergraduate Research Opportunity) program, joining a team of four developers and designers at the [MIT Media Lab](http://media.mit.edu). With the concept of "social cycling" as a starting point, we conceived, designed, and implemented a mobile application to facilitate the creation of real-life social networks based on a user's local Hubway stations.

This project found me working with the Android SDK once again; since another team member was developing for iOS, I developed natively for android, working in Eclipse with the ADT plugin. For the backend, we used [Parse]("http://parse.com"), a backend-as-a-service that simplifies sharing a database between various mobile platforms.

### The Team
- [Sandra Richter](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/sandra-y-richter/29/597/19b) - Project Lead, Design Lead
- [Danny Yuan](http://www.linkedin.com/in/dannyyuan) - iOS Development
- [Jyotishka Biswas](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jyotishka-biswas/65/44/3b1) - Web Development
- [Stephanie Lee](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/stephanie-lee/65/655/b8a) - Graphic Design
- [Ryan Chipman](/) (Me) - Android Development

### Background
The concept behind this project originated long before the project itself ever began. Sandra Richter, student at the MIT Media Lab Changing Places group and head of this project, had done significant research into the nature of bicycling in America. Specifically, she noticed that, while biking was often a social activity in European cities, it was a decidedly individual pursuit in American cities.

The concept, then, was to change that -- to bring about "social cycling" in American cities. Prior to this project, Sandra and other colleagues of hers had mocked up a few different app designs, but none that seemed perfect. So, when I entered the picture, we were starting fresh, with only the concept to work from.

### On Hold
As the spring semester finished and team members became engrossed in our respective summer jobs, the time to work on it was simply not available. There was no UROP team continuing the project during the fall of the next year, and, at the end of Winter 2013, Sandra returned to Germany. So as of right now, the project is not making any forward progress, and exists only (I think) in my GitHub repository. The concept behind the project, however, is as good as ever, and I hope to possibly come back to it some day, either on my own or with other open-source contributors, to bring it to fruition.
